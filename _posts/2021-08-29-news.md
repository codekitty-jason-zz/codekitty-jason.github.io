## Code Kitty is 4 today!

 It's hard to believe that it's been _four years_ since we started Code Kitty! In that time we've reached over _200 children_, been featured in multiple publications, and done a whole lot of innovating around the idea that everyone wins when _everyone_ wins. 

After all this, it feels like we're just getting started.  This year marks a turning point in Code Kitty, when we devote more time and resources than ever before to reaching more kids than ever before.

Thanks for coming along with us!
