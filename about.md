## Our Mission

> Our mission is to show girls and other underrepresented groups that technology skills are available to anyone with an interest, and to cultivate that interest in as many learners as possible.

We are a Minnesota (Twin Cities area) based 501(c)(3) tax-exempt non-profit formed in 2017. Our team is made up of engineers and educators who are passionate about showing students how to think like an engineer, and that they can build robots, use code and engineering to solve problems, and more.

## Our Model

Code Kitty teaches using an innovative workshop model which focuses on building interest and skills by showing students that they can build robots and write code. We use high-interest narratives to put the students in a situation where they want to build and code, and we hand them a very-low-cost 3D printed robot kit to learn on (and keep at the end of the workshop!). We then use the narrative to guide the students through building the robot, learning how to code in python, and actually writing custom code right on the robot to make it move, meow and purr (it _is_ a kitty robot after all), play music, and use 14 different built-in sensors to interact with the real world.
