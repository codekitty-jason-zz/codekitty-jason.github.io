New to coding? No problem! We love teaching people how awesome it is to know how to code, and how to think like an engineer.  

Not sure if that's you? _Try this_.

Coding is basically entering instructions that your  computer follows. That's it. 

Ever use a calculator? Then you've already coded (or _programmed)_ a computer. You type in  
\`\`\`python

1+1  
\`\`\`

and press \`\`\`python = \`\`\`

Python takes what you  typed in. _computes_* it, and gives the answer:  
\`\`\`python 2\`\`\`
